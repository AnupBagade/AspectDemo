# AspectDemo
Project deals with endpoints testing of demo site https://reqres.in/.

Project Debrief:
  •	AspectDemo performs testing on login, register, users and unknown endpoints
  •	Two packages have been created one consisting of endpoints and another consisting of test cases.
  •	Test Data is placed in test_data.py. Hence isolating completely from test cases and request methods.
  •	Reports folder have been created to save a single report for the entire test suite for every round of testing.
  •	Testing is triggered from main.py. Navigate to Aspect Demo and run python main.py.

Requirements
  •	Requests
  •	HTMLTestRunner

Note:
Since data submitted was not saving in the database, efficient validation cases could not be built for the provided API.
I have built AspectDemo on windows platform. I didn’t have a resource(machine/VM) with a Linux platform hence couldn’t build project       compatible with both Windows and Linux.
